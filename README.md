# Rotten-Tomatoes-Movies-Rating-Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the Tomatometer Status of movies — Rotten, Fresh, or Certified Fresh — using machine learning techniques.
The model leverages both structured movie features (such as genre, runtime, and content rating) and text-based critic reviews processed through NLP techniques like TF-IDF vectorization.
By combining traditional feature engineering with text classification, the project builds a multi-class prediction system capable of understanding critic sentiment and movie characteristics to accurately classify films.
