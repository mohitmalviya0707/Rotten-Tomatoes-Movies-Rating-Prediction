I started by understanding the problem as a multi-class classification task. Since reviews were at the critic level, I aggregated them to the movie level. I removed leakage-related columns and engineered structured as well as NLP-based features using TF-IDF. I trained multiple models and found that combining structured and text features significantly improved performance.
🎯 Why This Logic Strong Hai?
Because:
Data understanding clear tha
Leakage avoid kiya
Feature engineering kiya
Multiple models compare kiye
Output properly interpret kiya
